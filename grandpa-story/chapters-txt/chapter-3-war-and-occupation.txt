Chapter 3: War & Occupation (1941-1945)

World War II started in Europe in 1939. Germany and Italy were allies in the war. In 1941 (I believe) they declared war on Yugoslavia, and my part of the country was occupied by Italy. We woke up one morning and there were thousands of Italian soldiers in the countryside. They only stayed there a few weeks. The Italians were replaced by German troops. Two German soldiers on a sidecar motorbike occupied our town after the Italians left.

Our schools were changed to German language schools, taught by German teachers. This is were I learned to speak German. Most people seemed to prefer the German occupiers over the Italians.

After Germany went to war with Russia in 1942 (I believe), the communists and various national groups started to resist and fight the Germans. When the Allies decided to support the communist Jugoslavian leader Tito, the nationalist people broke with the resistance and allied themselves with the Germans and Italians and this started a civil war among the groups.
