Chapter 5: Refugee Years (1946-1951)

During that time I worked in the camp's food supply warehouse. This was a lucky break for us, because there was much competition for that type of work. For my work, I earned extra food rations that helped our family to get along. The last two years of that period I have worked for the British Army in their officers' resort hotel on the Lake Worthersee by Velden. I worked as a handyman, doing all types of housekeeping work. I was earning a small salary that helped the family to get along.

Back in the D.P. camp, my mother was working hard to get us approved for immigration to a new country. The countries that were taking people were: Argentina, Australia, Canada and USA. Nobody was very eager to take in a woman with three young children. But her persistence finally paid off--we were accepted for immigration to the USA, which was our first choice. The Catholic Relief Organization sponsored our family and made it possible for us to immigrate.
