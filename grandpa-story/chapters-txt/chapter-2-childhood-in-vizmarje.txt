Chapter 2: Childhood in Vizmarje (1935-1941)

About 1935, our family moved to a village of Vizmarje (I remember the house number was 88) pri St. Vidu, about 10 kilometers from Ljubljana. Here, we would call it a suburb of the city. We moved to a house that was owned by my mother's aunt Fani (grandfather's sister), who worked for some high British official in Cairo, Egypt. At that time, Egypt was a British colony. I remember moving into our new home. I liked the area and the friends that I made there. My first friend was Marko Polensek, a brother of Tony Polensek who visited us in Franklin Park on a couple of occasions. Marko later moved to Canada. I have later lost touch with him.

My father started his own business in Vizmarje, producing leather goods. He was a very accomplished craftsman in his trade. All the products were hand-made. Mother was at times the sales representative and made trips exhibiting and selling the merchandise that my father produced. My father usually had a couple of apprentices who stayed with him to learn the trade and normally lived with us.

My sister Mary and my brother John were both born while we lived in Vizmarje.

I started school in 1937 in St. Vid. I walked to school--about one-half hour each way. I attended school there until 1946. It was a public school. All the children in the area went to the same school. The school also provided about two hours of religious training each week, given by the parish priests. I also attended the catholic church in St. Vid.
