By 1950 the city produced about one twentieth of the U.S. manufacturing output, and over a third of its employed residents worked in factories:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. Industries ranged from steel and machinery to candy and printing, providing thousands of jobs.\n\nThis booming industry offered steady employment for many working-class families and immigrants. New Americans often took factory jobs or apprenticed in trades. Technical schools and unions helped workers advance. Many veterans and immigrants used these opportunities to earn stable wages, support families, and pursue the “American Dream.”",
