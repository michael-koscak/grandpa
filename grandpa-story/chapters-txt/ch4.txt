About **50,000** ethnic German civilians perished in brutal internment camps due to starvation, disease, or execution:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} before the survivors were finally transferred out (the Red Cross arranged transports from camps like Sterntal in Slovenia to Austria in late 1945):contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. \n\nMark’s family, though not ethnic German, was swept up in this climate of ethnic and political cleansing. In early 1946, they were forced from their home and pressured to claim **German ancestry** so that British-occupied Austria would accept them as refugees. Many other Slovene families associated with anti-communist or religious groups were similarly uprooted or intimidated into exile. Austria, divided into Allied zones, received tens of thousands of these deportees – with Carinthia (the British Zone) taking in Slovenian and Croatian refugees. Thanks to Mark’s mother’s German language skills, his family gained entry into Austria, where they lived as Displaced Persons rather than face further persecution in Yugoslavia:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}.",
