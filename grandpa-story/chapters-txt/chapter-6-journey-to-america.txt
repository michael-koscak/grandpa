Chapter 6: Journey to America (1951)

In August of 1951 we packed up our few belongings and were on our way to Bremerhaven, Germany, our port of embarkation. We were all very happy and full of expectations. We were all ready to work hard on whatever it might be to get a start in our new country. With several hundred other people, we were loaded on an American Navy troop carrier, General Muir, and arrived in New York about seven or eight days later. On the way, we passed through a bad storm and all of us got a good taste of seasickness. Mother was pretty sick. At that time, I spoke some English and I translated the ship commander's announcements to the passengers over the ship's intercom system.

We arrived in New York harbour and were awed by the size of the city, the tall buildings and the automobile traffic. What a country! The Salvation Army was there to treat us with coffee and doughnuts. The Catholic Relief people gave us twenty dollars and put us on a train to Chicago. We did not have any idea what would happen when we got there--we did not know a soul in Chicago. But the good Lord was good to us and things worked out pretty good. Two young men from the Slovenian community in Chicago, around Cermack Road and Damen Avenue were waiting for us at the train station in Chicago and provided for a temporary stay with different people--all complete strangers. After a few days, they arranged for us to rent a small apartment.
