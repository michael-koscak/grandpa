In total, over **400,000** displaced persons were able to immigrate to the U.S. under these programs by 1952.<br><br>Securing a U.S. visa typically required a **sponsor** who would guarantee housing and employment for the refugee family, ensuring they wouldn’t become a “public charge.” Many American religious and charitable organizations stepped up to fulfill this role. The **Catholic Relief Organization** mentioned in the memoir refers to **Catholic Relief Services (CRS)** – the U.S. Catholic agency that, along with the National Catholic Welfare Conference, helped resettle refugees. Catholic agencies worked with counterparts in Europe to locate American parishes or families willing to sponsor DP families:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. They provided affidavits of support, arranged ocean passage, and met refugees at the port of entry. In Mark’s case, *Catholic Relief* sponsorship meant a Catholic parish or family in the U.S. had agreed to receive his family, provide initial housing, and help find work:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. This was crucial for a single mother with three children, as such cases were often harder to place. Thanks to his mother’s persistence and the backing of CRS, Mark’s family left Austria in 1951 – joining the wave of DP refugees starting new lives in America.
