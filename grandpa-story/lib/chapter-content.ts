  'origins-and-family-roots': [
    `This is at the urging of my son Mark, who asked me to document the Koscak family's origin and history and to describe some of the more memorable events in my life. I have tried to do that to the best of my knowledge and recollection.`,
    
    `I was born on November 23, 1930, and named Marko Franc Koscak (now Mark F.). I was born in the city of Ljubljana, which is the capital of Slovenia. Slovenia was at that time a part of the kingdom and later (since 1945) the Republic of Yugoslavia. Slovenia is now an independent country of about 3 million people.`,
    
    `My parents were Marko Koscak (called Mirko) and Marija Koscak (now Mary). I was baptized Roman Catholic. I was the first of my parents' three children. The three of us were born about five years apart. My sister was named Florijana Marija (she was called Cvetka--meaning flower) and is now Mary, was born on April 29, 1935. My brother Ivo (now John) was born on March 26, 1941. Our native language was Slovenian, which is a Slavic language. The Slovenian language has common roots with other Slavic languages but is a distinct language of its own. Because of the lack of use, my current ability to speak in my native language is getting pretty poor.`,
    
    `My father and mother were married in Ljubljana on September 8, 1929. They rented an apartment in that city and lived there until I was about four years old. I believe that the city has about 100,000 inhabitants. The river Ljubljanca flows through the city. I was told that when I was a toddler, I fell into the river from a city bridge. My father jumped into the river after me and rescued me.`,
    
    `My mother was born on May 6, 1907. Her parents were Vincent and Marija (maiden name Skitek) Kanonik. She was born in Ravne na Koroskem, a small town in the northeastern part of Slovenia and close to the Austrian border. At the time, this was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The people in that part of the country were mostly bilingual--spoke both Slovenian and German. My mother always spoke a very excellent German. My mother had one younger brother, Vincent--called Cencl. My grandfather was a metal worker and worked in a local factory. My grandmother on my mother's side died at an age of 32 from some type of liver problems, when my mother was about seven years old. This was during the 1st World War and, at the time of her death, my grandfather was serving in the Austrian army. He was released from army duty soon after the grandmother's death to take care of his two children. He later remarried. He married a widow with four children. The oldest daughter, a girl of my mother's age, caused my mother a lot of grief and this eventually resulted in my mother being sent away to work at the age of fourteen, in the City of my birth, Ljubljana. My mother was employed in the household of a well-to-do family that owned a large leather goods manufacturing factory. She was well-liked by the people she worked for and they treated her very well. It was there that she met my father who was an employee at the factory.`,
    
    `My maternal grandfather died as a result of diabetes and lung problems, at the age of 58. I was told that I have seen my grandfather when I was very young, but I do not remember him. Several of his family members also had diabetes problems.`,
    
    `My uncle Cencl also worked in the local metal factory (it was the main employer of the area). He was also a musician and played several instruments in a band that played for weddings and other celebrations. He caught a bad cold that eventually turned into tuberculosis, and he died as a young man at the age of 23. My uncle had a son, Ernest, with his bride-to-be. He got seriously ill and died before they could get married. I have never met my cousin Ernest, but he lives in the town of Ravne na Koroskem, in Slovenia. He is married and has two children, Ernest and Erika. I understand that at this point he has three grandchildren. Cousin Ernest is about my age. He is a farmer.`,
    
    `My father was born on April 24, 1904, in the village of Zagrad pri Skocjanu. His parents were Franc and Ana Koscak. My father's birthplace was located in the southeastern part of Slovenia, close to the Croatian border. At that time, this was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. My father and his family only spoke Slovenian. There were fourteen children in my father's family, one of them died at birth. Of the remaining children, there were seven boys: my father Mirko, Franc, Joze, Ivan, Karl, Andrej, Lojze, and five girls: Toncka, Micel, Anica, Neska, and Lojzka. My grandparents owned a small vineyard. My grandfather was a tradesman. He produced and repaired horsegear that was used for horse-drawn buggies and land-tilling. He produced and repaired all types of leather gear that was needed to hitch the horses to a cart or a plow. He would spend much of his time on the road, going from one farmer to the next, to work on the farmer's horsegear. He would take some of his payments in farmers goods and take them home to his family. My father served his apprenticeship with his father and learned the leatherware trade from him.`,
    
    `My father served his required time (I believe two years) in the Yugoslav army. He was a cavalryman and served in a select unit of the king of Yugoslavia's guard. After the military service, my father went to work for a leather goods manufacturer in Ljubljana. There he learned to hand-produce all types of leatherware, including suitcase, ladies bags, wallets, change purses, and various leather sports articles-including soccer balls, hand balls, etc.`,
    
    `Both grandparents on my father's side died at an advanced age, apparently of natural causes, after our family was out of the country. I am not sure of their age at that time. I believe that all my father's brothers and sisters are dead at this time, with the exception of uncle Joze who now lives in Australia. He was a shoe manufacturer and owned a large shoe store in Ljubljana. He had to flee the country during the communist regime. He now produces shoes and owns a small store in Sydney, Australia. His wife and two children returned to their homeland. He lives in Australia with his new family.`,
    
    `In addition to uncle Joze's children, I believe that there are several other cousins from my father's side of the family. I have never met any one of them. I understand that a cousin now lives in the grandparents house with her family.`,
    
    `One of my grandfather's step-sons (Karl) and his wife are the parents of Tony Stekl, who is a Roman Catholic priest. We met Tony when he visited here, on two occasions. He is now a parish priest in Vienna, Austria, where he serves the large number of Slovenians that work in that city.`,

  'childhood-in-vizmarje': [
    `About 1935, our family moved to a village of Vizmarje (I remember the house number was 88) pri St. Vidu, about 10 kilometers from Ljubljana. Here, we would call it a suburb of the city. We moved to a house that was owned by my mother's aunt Fani (grandfather's sister), who worked for some high British official in Cairo, Egypt. At that time, Egypt was a British colony. I remember moving into our new home. I liked the area and the friends that I made there. My first friend was Marko Polensek, a brother of Tony Polensek who visited us in Franklin Park on a couple of occasions. Marko later moved to Canada. I have later lost touch with him.`,
    
    `My father started his own business in Vizmarje, producing leather goods. He was a very accomplished craftsman in his trade. All the products were hand-made. Mother was at times the sales representative and made trips exhibiting and selling the merchandise that my father produced. My father usually had a couple of apprentices who stayed with him to learn the trade and normally lived with us.`,
    
    `My sister Mary and my brother John were both born while we lived in Vizmarje.`,
    
    `I started school in 1937 in St. Vid. I walked to school--about one-half hour each way. I attended school there until 1946. It was a public school. All the children in the area went to the same school. The school also provided about two hours of religious training each week, given by the parish priests. I also attended the catholic church in St. Vid.`,

  'war-and-occupation': [
    `World War II started in Europe in 1939. Germany and Italy were allies in the war. In 1941 (I believe) they declared war on Yugoslavia, and my part of the country was occupied by Italy. We woke up one morning and there were thousands of Italian soldiers in the countryside. They only stayed there a few weeks. The Italians were replaced by German troops. Two German soldiers on a sidecar motorbike occupied our town after the Italians left.`,
    
    `Our schools were changed to German language schools, taught by German teachers. This is were I learned to speak German. Most people seemed to prefer the German occupiers over the Italians.`,
    
    `After Germany went to war with Russia in 1942 (I believe), the communists and various national groups started to resist and fight the Germans. When the Allies decided to support the communist Jugoslavian leader Tito, the nationalist people broke with the resistance and allied themselves with the Germans and Italians and this started a civil war among the groups.`,
  ],
  
  'communist-takeover-and-loss': [
    `In the spring of 1945, the Allies were defeating Germany and the German troops retreated from our area. The communists took over the country. Soon afterwards, the new regime required all men to report to a neighboring town.`,
    
    `Our father also went there. With a large number of other men, father was arrested and put in jail. They were considered enemies of the new regime. My mother and I went to the town where he was held in jail, but we could only see him waving to us from far away. He looked very pale and weak. It was several weeks after that we were told that father died in prison. Again we went to the prison location where some guard pointed to a spot behind a fence where he said that father was buried. There was no sign of a grave or anything. We never saw his body or any of his belongings. We found out later that the men who were held as political prisoners were starved severely and beaten daily, and that many of them died, as apparently did my father.`,
    
    `Soon after my father's alleged death, the secret police started picking up whole families during the night and taking them to lockups, and we found out later that they were being held in various detention centers and most of them were later deported to neighboring countries.`,
    
    `Our turn came on a January night (all these things were done at night) of 1946 when two officials arrived at our house and announced that we all have a few minutes to pick up a few essentials and that we have to leave our home and go with them. We were held at a couple of different lockups in Ljubljana and Maribor for several months. Later in the year we were put on a train and deported to Austria. We were told that we better tell the Austrian and British authorities (the part of Austria was at that time occupied by British forces) that we were German descent and that if we were not accepted in Austria that they are going to keep on sending us across the border until they would take us. We were glad that we were accepted on the first try. The fact that my mother spoke a good German helped us. The four of us spent the next five years as refugees in the Kellerberg Displaced Persons Camp in Austria. During all the difficult times, our mother was the really strong person who battled all the adversities and kept us together and managed to have us survive as a family unit. She deserves all the credit and all our love. Thank God for her!`,
  ],
  
  'refugee-years': [
    `During that time I worked in the camp's food supply warehouse. This was a lucky break for us, because there was much competition for that type of work. For my work, I earned extra food rations that helped our family to get along. The last two years of that period I have worked for the British Army in their officers' resort hotel on the Lake Worthersee by Velden. I worked as a handyman, doing all types of housekeeping work. I was earning a small salary that helped the family to get along.`,
    
    `Back in the D.P. camp, my mother was working hard to get us approved for immigration to a new country. The countries that were taking people were: Argentina, Australia, Canada and USA. Nobody was very eager to take in a woman with three young children. But her persistence finally paid off--we were accepted for immigration to the USA, which was our first choice. The Catholic Relief Organization sponsored our family and made it possible for us to immigrate.`,
  ],
  
  'journey-to-america': [
    `In August of 1951 we packed up our few belongings and were on our way to Bremerhaven, Germany, our port of embarkation. We were all very happy and full of expectations. We were all ready to work hard on whatever it might be to get a start in our new country. With several hundred other people, we were loaded on an American Navy troop carrier, General Muir, and arrived in New York about seven or eight days later. On the way, we passed through a bad storm and all of us got a good taste of seasickness. Mother was pretty sick. At that time, I spoke some English and I translated the ship commander's announcements to the passengers over the ship's intercom system.`,
    
    `We arrived in New York harbour and were awed by the size of the city, the tall buildings and the automobile traffic. What a country! The Salvation Army was there to treat us with coffee and doughnuts. The Catholic Relief people gave us twenty dollars and put us on a train to Chicago. We did not have any idea what would happen when we got there--we did not know a soul in Chicago. But the good Lord was good to us and things worked out pretty good. Two young men from the Slovenian community in Chicago, around Cermack Road and Damen Avenue were waiting for us at the train station in Chicago and provided for a temporary stay with different people--all complete strangers. After a few days, they arranged for us to rent a small apartment.`,

  'building-a-new-life': [
    `My first job in Chicago was with Hines Lumber company. I remember lugging big doors around all day. I worked there one day only. Somebody found a better job for me with a company that was manufacturing house trailers--the Glider Trailer Company. I was trained making cabinets for the trailers. After a while, I started attending the De Vry's school of electronics at night. Electronics was a new industry at that time and I thought this might be a good field to get into. I attended that school for about 18 month. In 1952, I started to work as a T.V. technician, working for the Admiral Company, a major television manufacturer at that time. I worked there until I was drafted into the U.S Army, in November 1953.`,
    
    `In the summer of 1952, my good fortune continued, I met the girl of my dreams who was to become my future wife. I attended a German picnic at the old Riverview amusement park which was located at Western Avenue and Belmont, in Chicago and has since been demolished. I ran into a group of about five girls that had this very strong family resemblance--the Tiedmann girls. Wally and I started to go out together soon thereafter and were engaged in the fall of 1953.`,
    
    `Wally Tiedmann was born in Obeliai, Lithuania, on July 21, 1932. Her parents Johann and Natalie Tiedmann were of German descent and owned a farm. Wally was the fifth of eight children. She has two brothers: John and Siegmund and four sisters: Jenny, Annie, Heddy, Elsie, and Irma.`,
    
    `In November of 1953, I was drafted into the U.S. Army. For the next two years, I became G.I. No. US 55449878. Fortunately, the Korean war just came to an end at that time. I spent a very miserable eight weeks in basic army training in Fort Leonard Wood, in Missouri. I spent another eight weeks in radio communications training in Fort Knox in Kentucky. After that, the unit that I was assigned to was to be shipped overseas. Half the company, last names starting from A to J were sent to Germany, and the other half from K to Z to Korea. I was not to happy about my destination.`,
    
    `My unit spent several weeks in Tacoma Washington, before we were loaded on a troop carrier in Seattle, for the trip to Pusan, Korea. I spent about five months in Korea. I was assigned to an anti-aircraft-artillery battalion, stationed at an U.S. Air Force airbase north of the Korean capitol of Soeul.`,
    
    `We lived in tents that were set up at the edge of rice paddies and just across from where the Air Force jets were revving up their engines before taking off. I spent most of my time maintaining radio communications equipment. Korea, at that time was a very poor, war-ravaged country. The people were very poor.`,
    
    `In the summer of 1954, my battalion was transferred to Camp Drake, just outside Tokyo, Japan. This was quite a change in our standard of living. I did not miss Korea a bit. My unit stayed at Camp Drake about five or six month. I made my U.S. citizenship in Tokyo during my stay there. I also started to get my promotions to Private First Class, Corporal, and later to Sergeant. At one of the monthly paydays, my first Sergeant told me that I better buy a $1.00 raffle ticket. The first prize of the raffle was a new car. A couple of months later my number was drawn and I owned a brand new 1945 Ford Fairlane. Around that time, my battalion was getting ready to be transferred to the southern Japanese city of Nagoya. I had to really hustle to sell the car to a Japanese car dealer. He paid me $2100.00 in Yen. At 360 Yen to a Dollar, and with the largest Japanese denomination of 100 Yen, I received a 5-pound brown bag full of Japanese money. At that time, there was no official way for me to convert the Yen into Dollars. The conversion of the Japanese money into dollars was a real experience for me. My company commander allowed me to stand in the pay line and sell Yen to my fellow-soldiers who needed the Japanese money to go out on the town. It took me two paydays to convert the money. Soon after that my battalion was moved to Nagoya. I stayed there until September of 1955 when I was shipped back to the United States and released from the Army.`,

  'family-and-career': [
    `On January 7, 1956, I married my fiancee, Wally Tiedmann, in the St. Stephen's Church, around Wallcot and Cermak, on the South Side of Chicago. My best man was Joe Ocepek, husband of Gisela Ocepek. We had a wedding reception at the Rainbow Gardens around the area of Armitage and Pulaski. We spent our honeymoon on a railroad trip to Phoenix, Arizona. We rented an apartment around 3500 West Wabansia, in Chicago, and lived there for a year. Wally worked for the Admiral T.V. Company and I started working for Motorola. We later moved to an apartment at 1521 N. Avers. It was here that our first son, Mark was born. Wally deliverd him at the Columbus hospital in Chicago. His godparents were my sister Mary and my brother John.`,
    
    `In the meantime, my sister Mary and Wally's brother John have met and were married to each other in January of 1957. The Koscak and Tiedmann connection was growing stronger. John and Mary had three sons: John, Jim, and Victor.`,
    
    `My brother John was married to Marianne Millich in May of 1965. They have two daughters: Tina and Cindy.`,
    
    `Wally and I purchased our home at 3629 Scott Street, in Franklin Park and moved in during January 1959. Our family has lived there ever since. On June 25, 1963, our daughter Jane was born, in Gottlieb Hospital, in Melrose Park. My sister Mary and brother John were again the godparents (there were not that many Catholics in our extended family). On August 18, 1965, our youngest, Ed was born in Gottlieb Hospital. We were now what was, at the time considered an average American family with three children. Uncle Sepp Wallner and grandmother Mary Koscak were Eddie's godparents. Wally and I are very proud of all three of our children.`,
    
    `Wally gave up her outside employment and devoted all her time raising a family. She was and is still doing a heck of a job and has always been the glue of our family!`,
    
    `In 1962, I started working as a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy, at the Naval Ordnance Plant in Forest Park, Il. I was hired as an Electronics Mechanic. I worked on testing the electronics guidance systems of Navy torpedo's and other electronics equipment. After some time on the job, I was promoted into several management positions. In 1971, the Forest Park operation was moved to an area close to Seattle Washington. I was offered a relocation to that area but did not want to move from this area. I started to work for the Army Ammunition Procurement Agency in Joliet. I worked there as a Management Analyst for two years and again that function was moved to Rock Island, Il. I applied for a job with the FAA and started to work for the Agency in 1973 as a Management Analyst. I have worked there ever since.`,
    
    `All three of our children attended the local public elementary schools and the East Leyden High School. They all graduated from the Northern Illinois University. We belonged to the Maria Goretti Catholic Church in Schiller Park and attended mass there. The children attended the CCD classes.`,
    
    `Our son Mark started working for the CNA Insurance company and soon moved to Nashville, Tennessee. After returning to Chicago for about two years, he moved back to Nashville, purchased a home there, and he still lives there now.`,
    
    `Our daughter Jane was married to Mark Bedard on September 19, 1987 at the St. Maria Goretti Church. The wedding reception (about 220 people) was held at the Villa Brunetti Reception Hall, in Franklin Park. Mark and Jane soon purchased a home in Carol Stream and they still live there at the present time.`,
    
    `Our son Ed married Kathy Watry on May 12, 1990, at the Mary Queen of Heaven Catholic Church in Elmhurst, Ill. The wedding reception was at the Addison Country Club, in Addison, Ill, and was attended by about 250 people. Ed and Kathy soon moved to St. Louis when Ed was transferred there from his job. They purchased a home in the St. Louis area. On August 23, 1992, Ed and Kathy became the parents of Michael Mark Koscak and Wally and I became grandparents for the first time. Michael is getting baptized on October 11, 1992. Jane and Mark Bedard will be the godparents.`,
    
    `And life goes on--------------------.`,
